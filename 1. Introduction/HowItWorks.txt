-> Everything in js happens in an " Execution Context "
-> Execution Context is like a box where the code is Executed.
    -> It has 2 components 
      1. Memory component [akn variable Environment]
            where all the variables and functions are stored as key : value pairs
      2. Code component [akn Thread of Execution]
            -> It Executes 1 line at a time.


-> JS is a synchronous single - Threaded(It Executes one command at a time in a specific order ) lang.
