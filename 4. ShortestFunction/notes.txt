-> Even though we donot write any program in the console, The JS Engine do its job.

Window [Global Object in Browsers]:
---------
Window is a big object created by the javascript engine, Which provides many functions.
It is created along with Global Execution Context.

this :
--------
It is variable created by the JS engine at the beginning.


-> At the Global Level or at the Base Level
   this === window


Global Space is nothing but any code which we write outside the function.

var a = 10;
console.log(window.a);
console.log(a);

both the console statements are same.
If we write any variable without placing anything before it , it is searched in the Global Space.
