let and const declarations are hoisted.

But, let and const are allocated in different memory space but not in global.

Temporial Dead Zone:
The time between which since the let variable is hoisted  and It is initialized.

When We try to access the variable in a Temporial Dead Zone it shows a " referrence Error ".

-> If the variable is not defined it gives Error called " referrence Error : the variable is not defined "
-> But if we try to access the variable which is in Temporial Dead Zone it gives "referrence Error : cannot access
before initialization "

-> let variables are " not " attached to window object.
-> let is a little more strict than var.
-> redeclaration is possible in var but not in let[If we try to I gives a syntax error]. 
-> The JS engine rejects upfront if it sees any redeclaration.

let a = 10;
var a = 100;

The above program shows " SyntaxError ".

CONST :
-> It is more strict that let.
-> In let the variable can be initialized anytime, but in case of const it should be initialized once it is 
declared.
-> If we do that [SyntaxError : missing initializer in const declaration].
-> If we try to reassign the const variable it show [TypeError: Assignment to constant variable].

To avoid Temporial Dead Zones it is preferred to place the initialization on the top.
