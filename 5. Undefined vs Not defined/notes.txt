undefined is a placeholder where it is assigned to a variable before the value.

javaScript is loosly typed language becz it doesn't attach its variables to any datatype.

var a;
a = 10;
a = "ajay";

Every Line is valid.


below code is Not a Good Practise.
a = undefined; XXXXXX it created many inconsisteny in the code.
console.log(a);
